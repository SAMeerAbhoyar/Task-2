# Task-2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

**Objective:**  
Understand the dataset using statistical summaries and visualizations to identify patterns and relationships.

**Tools Used:**  
Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

**Dataset:**  
Titanic-Dataset.csv containing details such as age, fare, class, gender, and survival status.

**Steps Followed:**  
1. Loaded and explored the dataset.  
2. Generated summary statistics.  
3. Plotted histograms for numerical features.  
4. Used boxplots to detect outliers.  
5. Created a correlation heatmap.  
6. Used pairplots for feature interactions.  
7. Visualized survival patterns using different charts.

**Visualizations:**  
Histograms, boxplots, pairplots, correlation heatmap, scatter plots, and survival comparisons.

**Final Result:**  
Observed data distribution, identified outliers, understood feature relationships, and extracted insights required for further processing.
